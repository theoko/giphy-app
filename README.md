## Setup 

#### If you don't have yarn installed, download and install it from [https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)
#### In order to set up the project, run `yarn install`

## Run

#### In order to start a local server, run `yarn start`
This will run the app in development mode. Your default browser will automatically 
go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) <br />

If edits are made, the page will automatically reload and the components will be re-rendered.


### Other Available Scripts (this section is copied from create-react-app)

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
